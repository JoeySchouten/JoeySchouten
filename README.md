## Hi! Iâ€™m Joey! 
Iâ€™m a creative professional who specialised in digital board games over the past half decade, bringing games to the table and various screens using Unity C# and Godotâ€™s GDScript. In these years while working as a Head of Development for a board game startup and as a freelance game developer, Iâ€™ve picked up a skill set as varied and broad as the game design, development, and publishing process. Now, Iâ€™m looking to apply my creativity and these skills to a new set of problems.
